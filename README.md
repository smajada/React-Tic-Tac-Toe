# Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a Tic Tac Toe game implemented in React.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several React components:

- `Board.jsx`: This is the main component that handles the game logic. It maintains the state of the board and determines the winner of the game.
- `Header.jsx`: This component displays the game's header.
- `Player.jsx`: This component displays which player's turn it is.
- `Square.jsx`: This component represents a single square on the game board.
- `WinnerModal.jsx`: This component displays a modal when a winner is determined.

## How to Play

The game is played just like traditional Tic Tac Toe. Players click on an empty square to make their move. The first player uses the ðŸŽƒ emoji and the second player uses the ðŸ‘» emoji. The game automatically determines when a player has won.

To reset the game, simply click the reset button.

## How to Run the Project
